A Long Journey
=======================

We are a team of students at **Télécom ParisTech** working on a project for our **Data Visualization** class. We wanted to tackle this issue that is to us fundamental. Because we hear so much about it, numbers of deaths are hard to comprehend. We wanted to make people understand our need to act as a society by making them feel something through the tragic journey of this family, illustrated by data from IOM’s Missing Migrants Project.
